# DataGen1

## How To Use:

This is a data generator. It is used to generate a hierarchically patterened string of characters.
To use, intialize the generator. The data will be stored in a queue at Generator.q.
Calling the method Generator.Generate(int numChars) populates the queue with a string of queues that has at least numChars characters. Once numChars is surpassed, it will add more characters until the pattern it is currently inputting is completed.
